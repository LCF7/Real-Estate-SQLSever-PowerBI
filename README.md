# Real-Estate-SQLServer-PowerBI: Property Prices Analysis in Waterloo Region

## Project Overview
This project employs Power BI to analyze and visualize property prices in the Waterloo region. It aims to demonstrate an effective Business Intelligence (BI) infrastructure setup from data modeling in SQL Server to connecting with the BI tool, thereby creating impactful visualizations and insights.

## SQL Server in the Project
The foundation of our visualization is built upon SQL Server. Detailed data modeling and normalization were conducted to ensure accurate data feeds into Power BI for fair and meaningful visualization comparisons.

## Additional Considerations
- **Security**: Implementations include security measures to protect data integrity and access.
- **Maintenance**: Outlined maintenance plans for the database and visualizations to ensure long-term reliability and performance.

## Maps
Maps provide intuitive geographic visualizations, which can be recreated and compared with similar visualizations in Tableau for geographic data analysis.

## Comparison with Other BI Tools
Future updates will include comparisons between Power BI and other visualization tools like Tableau to identify strengths, weaknesses, and optimal use cases for various BI platforms in the industry.

## Conclusion
Power BI proves to be an ideal tool for those needing a seamless integration with Microsoft technologies, offering an affordable and user-friendly interface for effective data visualization. This project exemplifies how structured data modeling and BI tools can transform raw data into actionable insights.
